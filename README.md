# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In the Banking Sector, in their daily transactions lot of fraudulent transactions are 
happening. If we are taking credit card fraudulent transactions alone, after the fraud 
happened it will be reported to the corresponding bank management. For the 
immediate solution bank is blocking the particular card for future transactions and 
advising his customer to change his password and related secured information. After 
that only, the particular bank/corporate started working with, how this fraud activity 
happened, what pattern the fraudsters used to hack the customer account. Once they 
find the pattern, the banking/corporate sector will work towards the loop hole and take 
necessary security actions to stop permanently with the same pattern related 
fraudulent transactions. Meanwhile by using the same pattern fraudsters would have 
done multiple fraudulent transactions which leads to huge amount loss. 
The problem statement is to understand the fraud transactions based on the features 
and also by building machine learning algorithm to detect the whether or not a 
transaction is fraud.
